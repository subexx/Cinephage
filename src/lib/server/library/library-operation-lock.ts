/**
 * Library Operation Lock
 *
 * In-process mutual exclusion between long-running library filesystem
 * operations (bulk renames, folder reorganizes, root-folder moves) and
 * library scans. A scan running while folders are being renamed sees a
 * half-renamed state and, because the scan diff is path-based, hard-deletes
 * the rows for moved files (jellyfin/jellyfin#16883 failure class).
 *
 * Rename/move operations acquire the lock; DiskScanService refuses to start
 * while it is held; the library watcher re-queues events instead of scanning.
 *
 * Invariant: `waiters.length > 0` implies `currentHolder !== null`. Ownership
 * transfers directly in `release()` (the holder assigns `currentHolder` to the
 * next waiter's operation before resolving it), so `isLocked` never observably
 * drops while waiters are queued.
 *
 * Prefer `withLock` over a raw `acquire()`: a caller that forgets to release
 * the acquired lock deadlocks every subsequent library operation.
 *
 * Note: `holder` may briefly report the next queued operation before its
 * wrapped function starts running — this is intentional and part of the
 * direct ownership handoff.
