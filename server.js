/**
 * Custom server entry point for production.
 *
 * This wraps the SvelteKit adapter-node server to configure HTTP settings
 * that improve compatibility with reverse proxies like Nginx.
 *
 * Issue: Node.js has a default keepAliveTimeout of 5 seconds, but reverse
 * proxies (Nginx, Traefik, etc.) typically use 60-75 seconds. This mismatch
 * causes 502 Bad Gateway errors when the proxy tries to reuse a connection
 * that Node already closed.
 *
 * Solution: Set keepAliveTimeout higher than the proxy's timeout.
